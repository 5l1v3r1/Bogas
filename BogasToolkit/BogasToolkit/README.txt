Bogas is a set of scripts for fuzzing applications (x86 optimally) and aiding in the generation of a buffer overflow. Optimal for OSCP training. This toolkit covers the 9 fundamental steps (Bogas scripts) in generating a basic overflow. Start at script zero (S0Checklist.txt) in a text editor so you don't need a whiteboard to jot Eip addresses and break points. Run each script dilligently against the program, and anotate what you were able to discover in S0Checklist.txt
